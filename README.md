# Daily-Tracker
Over Engineered Web App Designed to Track Daily Life

## NOTE - 12/10/2020

This project has been more or less abandoned because of lost interest, and
is not complete.

Originally, started this project as a way to get experience with different
design approachs and web concepts. This project implements some of the
following (non-exhaustive):

* A custom implementation of the mediator pattern from the
  [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library.
* Proxy pattern
* Strategy pattern
* NancyFx API
* Web caching via e-tag headers
* JWT authentication

Nothing in the project should be used as a guide for production code.
Everything here was done for educational purposes and very much
over engineered.
